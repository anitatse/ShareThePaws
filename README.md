# ShareThePaws

This web app was built in a group of 4 as part of a term project for the Relational Databases courses at the University of British Columbia. 

## Setup Notes

Need to set appropriate permissions for htdocs/temp and htdocs/upload directories for file upload to work successfully (this is assuming the application is run in xamppfiles)

## Context

The web app is modelling a simple dog walking service, where dog owners display their dogs and volunteers can request dogs to walk. An example user story: Fred (dog owner) walks his dog on his way to class/work, and wants a walker to meet him there. The walker, Sally, has time between her classes to play with a dog. She takes care of Rover(dog) for an hour, until Fred finishes and repossesses the canine. 

There are 2 types of users for this system, a dog walker and dog owner. Owners are able to upload their dogs. 

Volunteer dog walkers can browse through the selection of dogs and request a walk. Dog owners are able to accept a walk request, and leave a review once the walk is done. 

We implemented this in HTML/CSS and PHP, utilizing the Computer Science departmentâ€™s Oracle database
